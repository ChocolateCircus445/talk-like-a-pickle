  <h1>Information</h1>
  <p>This site turns your human speech (regardless of language) into pickle speak, and, no, It's not just a whole bunch of random
  letters. It uses letters and compounds to generate words. Here are the compounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>b - Sounds kind of like a "popping" sound, more like "p" than "b".</li>
    <li>d - Kind of like a short and sudden "duh", but like a whisper.</li>
    <li>f - Same as in English, but quieter.</li>
    <li>ft - Say "f", but suddenly put your tongue between your teeth to stop the sound.</li>
    <li>g - Like a hard "c", but quieter and slightly deeper.</li>
    <li>fg - Same as "f", but suddenly stop it with a "g".</li>
    <li>j - Sounds kind of like "ch", but quieter.</li>
    <li>h - Exhale with a medium gap between your teeth.</li>
    <li>hh - "h" but louder.</li>
    <li>k - Like the English "k", but quieter.</li>
    <li>glk - A gulp sound with a "k" at the end.</li>
    <li>n - Kind of like a gulp, but with an n instead of the actual gulp.</li>
    <li>ng - "n", but with an abrupt stop with a "g".</li>
    <li>s - Lick the back of your teeth, creating a sort of sloshing sound.</li>
    <li>t - Flick your tongue off the roof of your mouth, creating a sort of "clock" sound.</li>
    <li>v - Like "f", but deeper.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This all started when I was trying to go to sleep one night. I deliriously thought of a language called
    "pickle language", which consisted of simply clicks and saliva sloshing. My best ideas are created when
    I'm sleepy, so I decided to write it down. I'm glad I did.</p>
  <p>When this generates words, it stores the words in a list that gets erased everytime you reload the page.
    When it finds a word you previously translated, it puts it in its respective spot. Otherwise it generates
    a new word.</p>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't use punctuation. It will use different words depending on what punctuation you use.</li>
    <li>Capitalization matters. If you capitalize a word differently, it will use different words.</li>
    <li><span style="color: red">DO NOT USE QUOTATION MARKS! </span>This will screw up everything.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Features coming soon</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Saving and opening dialects</li>
    <li>Maybe reverse translation</li>
    <li>A few Easter eggs ;)</li>
  </ul>
